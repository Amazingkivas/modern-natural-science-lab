# phase-trajectories-lab

This repository contains python code for constructing phase trajectories of conservative and dissipative systems of differential equations using libraries:
- matplotlib
- scipy
- numpy

Files with the .py extension are intended solely for viewing the source code. It is recommended to launch in Jupiter Notebook by downloading Untitled1.ipynb file..
